	Java was developed by James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton but the main creator was James Gosling.
	Gosling is was born May 19, 1955. He is often referred to as DR. Java. He was elected a member of the National Academy of engineering in 2004 because of his achievements like the development of java and his contributions to the development of the windows system.
	Gosling worked at Sun Microsystem from 1986 to 2010. At Sun he invented an early Unix windowing system called NeWS, which became a lesser-used alternative to the still used X Window, because Sun did not give it an open source license.
