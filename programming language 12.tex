	\maketitle
	BASIC (Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) is a family of general-purpose, high-level programming languages whose design philosophy emphasizes ease of use. 
	It was invented by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz of Dartmouth on May 1 ,1964.
	
	\subsection{JOHN AND THOMAS}
	John was born on May 31 , 1926 and died on December 26 , 1992. He was a Hungarian born American computer scientist and mathematician.
	Thomas Eugene Kurtz (born February 22, 1928) is a retired Dartmouth professor of mathematics and computer scientist, who along with his colleague John G. Kemeny set in motion the then revolutionary concept of making computers as freely available to college students as library books were, by implementing the concept of time-sharing at Dartmouth College. In his mission to allow non-expert users to interact with the computer, he co-developed the BASIC programming language (Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) and the Dartmouth Time Sharing System during 1963 to 1964.
